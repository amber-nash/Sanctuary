#Sanctuary App


##Mission Statement

##Description

Sanctuary web and Android app provides communities with tools to protect themselves against ICE (Immigration & Customs Enforcement) Raids. Users can map and track ICE sightings in their communities, and vote on the validity of sightings to promote accurate data. A panic button feature allows users to instantly notify up to 5 contacts via text message if they are being targeted by a raid. Once the panic button has been selected, the app will generate a list of rights the user has in interacting with ICE during the raid. This app will be available in multiple languages.
