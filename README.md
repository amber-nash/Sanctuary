# Sanctuary App

## Description

Web and mobile app that provides communities with tools to protect themselves against ICE (Immigration & Customs Enforcement) Raids. Users can map and track ICE sightings in their communities, and vote on the validity of sightings to promote accurate data. A panic button feature allows users to instantly notify up to 5 contacts via text message if they are being targeted by a raid. Once the panic button has been selected, the app will generate a list of rights the user has in interacting with ICE during the raid. This app will be available in multiple languages.

## How Sanctuary was built

This was our final project at DevBootcamp. We hit our MVP after 5 days of coding and 1 day of planning. Communication was integral to our team's productivity - and not only did we communicate well, we had fun along the way! As a team, we agreed that this project should push our technical boundaries. Each team member contributed to both front and back-end.

## Mission Statement
At Sanctuary, we believe that everyone has the right to be informed about what is happening in their community. For families across America, Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE) and the threat of deportation, is a huge source of fear and anxiety. Navigating everyday life with that constant fear is debilitating. Sanctuary seeks to alleviate some of this fear while providing the immigrant community with ways to protect itself.

Our map tracker allows users to see where raids have taken place in their neighborhoods. We have built voting onto our tracker to keep false information from spreading, adding to the stresses of navigating America as an immigrant.

A ‘Know Your Rights’ page offers users vital information in how to navigate an interaction with ICE. Being targeted by ICE is frightening, but there are laws put in place to offer you some protections. Familiarize yourself with your rights.

Sanctuary’s panic button feature, allows you to quickly notify family and friends if you are involved in an ICE raid. With the click of a button, you can contact up to five people with a pre-written message, letting you focus on interacting with the officers and remembering to advocate for your rights.

Accessibility is incredibly important to us. We want to offer our services to everyone, and that means having our app available by computer, smartphone, and cellphone without smartphone capabilities, as well as having multiple languages to choose from. We are still working on adding languages and adapting our app to multiple technological platforms. If you have suggestions as to how we can improve our app, or would like to request a foreign language to be added, please send an email to: thesanctuaryapp@gmail.com.
