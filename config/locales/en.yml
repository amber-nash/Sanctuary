# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      mission_paragraph_1: "At Sanctuary, we believe that everyone has the right to be informed about what is happening in their community. For families across America, Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE) and the threat of deportation, is a huge source of fear and anxiety. Navigating everyday life with that constant fear is debilitating. Sanctuary seeks to alleviate some of this fear while providing the immigrant community with ways to protect itself."
      mission_paragraph_2: "Our map tracker allows users to see where raids have taken place in their neighborhoods. We have built voting onto our tracker to keep false information from spreading, adding to the stresses of navigating America as an immigrant."
      mission_paragraph_3: "A ‘Know Your Rights’ page offers users vital information in how to navigate an interaction with ICE. Being targeted by ICE is frightening, but there are laws put in place to offer you some protections. Familiarize yourself with your rights."
      mission_paragraph_4: "Sanctuary’s panic button feature, allows you to quickly notify family and friends if you are involved in an ICE raid. With the click of a button, you can contact up to five people with a pre-written message, letting you focus on interacting with the officers and remembering to advocate for your rights."
      mission_paragraph_5: "Accessibility is incredibly important to us. We want to offer our services to everyone, and that means having our app available by computer, smartphone, and cellphone without smartphone capabilities, as well as having multiple languages to choose from. We are still working on adding languages and adapting our app to multiple technological platforms. If you have suggestions as to how we can improve our app, or would like to request a foreign language to be added, please send an email to:"
